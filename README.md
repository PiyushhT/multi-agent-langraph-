Multi-Agent RAG System

🚀 Overview

The Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System is an AI-driven platform that leverages multiple intelligent agents to enhance information retrieval and processing. Built with LangGraph and LangChain, it efficiently manages data storage and retrieval using Astra DB. This system is designed to streamline complex workflows and improve AI-driven decision-making.

This repository contains only the Jupyter Notebook for the system. The UI has been developed separately and is uploaded in another repository.
